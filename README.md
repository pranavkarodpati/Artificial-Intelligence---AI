# Artificial-Intelligence---AI
This repository contains my projects related to Artificial Intelligence, where I apply AI techniques to solve real-world problems. 
The goal is to explore intelligent systems using machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven approaches.

**1. LSTM Model to Forecast Apple Stock**
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future Apple stock prices based on historical time series data.
LSTM is well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in financial data.

**2. Weather Forecasting Using Facebook Prophet**
A time series forecasting project where the Facebook Prophet model is used to predict future weather patterns. 
Prophet is designed for handling seasonality, trend changes, and holidays in time series data.

**3. Sentiment Analysis Using RNN**
In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is trained on movie review data to classify the sentiment (positive or negative).
It helps understand user opinions and emotions expressed in text.

**4. Emotion Detection Using CNN**
This project classifies six basic human emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, and neutral) from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
It's useful for emotion-aware applications like smart assistants and security systems.
